RedHat OpenShift Cluster Capacity Predictor

Overview
The RedHat OpenShift Cluster Capacity Predictor is an analytics-driven web application designed to model and evaluate cluster capacity scenarios using deterministic calculations.

The system enables users to simulate capacity additions, removals, and what-if scenarios while enforcing secure access through role-based authentication.
This project is being developed as a team-based capstone collaboration with enterprise-grade engineering standards.

Objectives
Implement deterministic capacity modeling logic
Support capacity addition and removal scenarios
Provide real-time what-if analytics
Enforce authentication and RBAC using Entra ID
Deliver a professional, production-style web application
